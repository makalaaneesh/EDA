Some datasets which I have explored, analysed, and presented some insights on.

### Perseverence
As part of https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019, I explored the distributions of answers given by practioners in the fields of  Data Science and Machine Learning

### Football
Because of my love for football, I picked up an events dataset and compared the major football leagues in Europe for passes, fouls, etc

### Bollywood
I analysed Bollywood movies to determine movie_counts, and how movie durations have changed over the years.

## Data Comics
I've created a few data comics as a result of the insights I've drawn from data:
